    <h2>Step by step</h2>
    <h3>Preparing the chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Butterfly the chicken breast from the thickest point</li>
        <li>Place butterflied chicken breast between two plastic wrap</li>
        <li>Tenderize chicken breast with a meat hammer until the thickness reaches half an inch</li>
        <li>Salt the chicken liberally, cover it, and place it in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow bowls. 
            The first one with all-purpose flour, 
            the second one with eggs beaten with water, 
            and the third one with panko breadcrumbs.
        </li>
        <li>Place chicken in the flour, turn to coat it on all sides, then shake off any excess flour.</li>
        <li>Dip the floured chicken into the egg mixture, coat it well, then shake off any excess.</li>
        <li>Dredge the chicken in Panko breadcrumbs. Shake off excess.</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 200°F.</li>
        <li>Add enough vegetable oil or canola oil to a large cast-iron or stainless steel skillet to be ½-inch deep. 
            Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F.
        </li>
        <li>Deep fry the chicken in the pan and cook it for 1 to 2 minutes, just until the crust sets. 
            Flip the chicken over and cook it for 1 to 2 minutes. Continue cooking the chicken and flipping 
            it over until it is golden brown on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the skillet. Drain excess grease by placing it on a clean wire rack over a baking sheet. 
            I don’t recommend using placing the chicken on paper towels because it will steam and the crust will get soggy. 
            Place the chicken in the 200°F oven to finish cooking (until the internal temperature is 165°F degrees when 
            checked with an instant-read thermometer).
        </li>
        <li>To your preference, cut the chicken katsu in thin strips or leave it as a whole and serve with sauce either on the side on directly on the katsu</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Preparing the glaze</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk together until smooth. Adjust the sauce according to your liking.</li>
    </ol>
